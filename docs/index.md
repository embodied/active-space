description: Active Space is an intermedia software framework for exploring embodied interaction
summary: >-
  Active Space (aSpace) is a software framework for creating networked intermedia art. Situated in theatres, galleries and online, our projects explore embodied <nobr>human-computer</nobr> interaction through movement and other forms of dynamic expression. Our research connects <nobr>body-centered</nobr> artistic practices with transdisciplinary methods for expanded media performance, multi-site interactivity and responsive system design.

In continuous development since 1994 by intermedia artist [John Crawford](http://jc.embodied.net/) and colleagues, the aSpace framework simplifies the process of creating interactive environments. Implemented using a mix of custom-built software, commercially available products and open-source programming tools, the aSpace media objects include systems for multi-channel live video and audio processing, generative animation, musical composition, mediabase storage/retrieval and high bandwidth networking. Associated motion tracking objects perform real-time sensing and analysis of location, speed, duration and various other characteristics of movement. The results of this analysis are used to generate video and audio in response to movement.

Motion tracking involves real-time sensing and analysis of location, speed, duration and various other characteristics of movement. Motion capture is the technique of sampling movement in 3D space and creating graphical representations derived from the resulting numeric data. Typical applications of motion capture tend to produce realistic animations, but the aesthetic focus of our work goes beyond realism. We employ motion tracking to explore notions of non-linear association, embodiment and reflexivity. The interplay between improvisational and compositional elements is of particular interest.
