Through a combination of demonstrations, discussion and experiential exercises, workshop participants gain practical experience with intermedia performance concepts and techniques, using the ASpace framework to support creative exploration. The workshops cover a selection of commercially-available products and open-source media programming tools, integrated with custom software components developed by [John Crawford](http://jc.embodied.net). A collaborative learning environment encourages exploration of the media objects and provides opportunities for investigating issues of embodied human-computer interaction, developing and deepening vocabularies and techniques for structured improvisation, mediated performance and responsive system design.

The workshops will be of particular interest to dancers, choreographers, musicians, composers, scenic and lighting designers, directors, actors, visual artists, animators, filmmakers, interface designers, computer scientists, engineers, architects, and anyone intrigued by issues of embodiment, technology and interactive experience.
